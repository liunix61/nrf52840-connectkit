# nRF Connect SDK

## Introduction

The nRF Connect SDK is a scalable and unified software development kit for building low-power wireless applications based on the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, and nRF91 Series wireless devices. It offers an extensible framework for building size-optimized software for memory-constrained devices as well as powerful and complex software for more advanced devices and applications.

It integrates the Zephyr™ real-time operating system (RTOS), a wide range of complete applications, samples, and protocol stacks such as Bluetooth® Low Energy, Bluetooth mesh, Matter, Thread/Zigbee and LTE-M/NB-IoT/GPS, TCP/IP. It also includes middleware such as CoAP, MQTT, LwM2M, various libraries, hardware drivers, Trusted Firmware-M for security, and a secure bootloader (MCUboot).

## Get Involved

We think the best way to learn is by doing. The following sections take you through the basics of nRF Connect SDK development and show you how to implement typical use cases with Nordic Semiconductor libraries and drivers on nRF52840 Connect Kit.
