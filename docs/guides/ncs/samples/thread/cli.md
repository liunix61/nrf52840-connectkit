# Thread CLI

The Thread CLI sample demonstrates how to send commands to a Thread device using the OpenThread Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI is integrated into the Zephyr shell.

!!! Tip "Sniffing packets from a Thread network" 
    You can use [nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4](../../../nrf802154-sniffer/index.md) to capture and analyze packets exchanged on a Thread network.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 2x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 2x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [Thread CLI] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/ncs-playground` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/ncs-playground
    ```

3. Build the sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    === "Default"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/openthread/cli
        ```

    === "Low power mode"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/openthread/cli -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-low_power.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=low_power.overlay
        ```

    === "Multiprotocol"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/openthread/cli -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-multiprotocol.conf
        ```

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the firmware to your board, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect nRF52840 Connect Kit to your computer using the USB-C Cable.
2. Open up a serial terminal, specifying the correct serial port that your computer uses to communicate with the board:

    === "macOS/Linux"

        Open up a terminal and run:

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        screen <serial-port-name> 115200
        ```

    === "Windows"

        1. Start [PuTTY].
        2. Configure the correct serial port and click __Open__:

3. Configure the required Thread network parameters with the `ot channel`, `ot panid`, and `ot networkkey` commands. Make sure to use the same parameters for all nodes that you add to the network. The following example uses the default OpenThread parameters:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="1" }
    uart:~$ ot channel 11
    Done
    uart:~$ ot panid 0xabcd
    Done
    uart:~$ ot networkkey 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
    Done
    ```

4. Enable the Thread network with the `ot ifconfig up` and `ot thread start` commands:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="7" }
    uart:~$ ot ifconfig up
    Done
    uart:~$ ot thread start
    Done
    ```

5. Invoke some of the OpenThread commands:

    1. Test the state of the Thread network with the `ot state` command. For example:

        ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="11"}
        uart:~$ ot state
        leader
        Done
        ```

    2. Get the Thread network name with the `ot networkname` command. For example:

        ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="14"}
        uart:~$ ot networkname
        OpenThread
        Done
        ```        

    3. Get the IP addresses of the current Thread network with the `ot ipaddr` command. For example:

        ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="17"}
        uart:~$ ot ipaddr
        fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
        fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:1000
        fdde:ad00:beef:0:a5b3:5dbd:97b2:474b
        fe80:0:0:0:3cae:981b:5d24:3f00
        Done
        ``` 

6. Test communication between the kits with the following command:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    ot ping ip_address_of_the_first_kit
    ```

    For example:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="1" }
    uart:~$ ot ping fdde:ad00:beef:0:a5b3:5dbd:97b2:474b
    16 bytes from fdde:ad00:beef:0:a5b3:5dbd:97b2:474b: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=24ms
    1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received. Packet loss = 0.0%. Round-trip min/avg/max = 24/24.0/24 ms.
    Done
    ```
