# Thread Co-processor

## Overview

The Thread Co-processor sample demonstrates how to implement [OpenThread’s Co-processor designs] inside the Zephyr environment. The sample uses the [Radio co-processor (RCP)] architecture.

The sample is based on [Zephyr’s OpenThread Co-Processor] sample. However, it customizes Zephyr’s sample to fulfill the nRF Connect SDK requirements (for example, by increasing the stack size dedicated for the user application), and also extends it with features such as:

- Increased Mbed TLS heap size.
- Lowered main stack size to increase user application space.
- No obsolete configuration options.
- Vendor hooks for co-processor architecture allowing users to extend handled properties by their own, customized functionalities.
- Thread 1.2 features.

!!! Tip "Sniffing packets from a Thread network" 
    You can use [nRF Sniffer for 802.15.4](../../../nrf802154-sniffer/index.md) to capture and analyze packets exchanged on a Thread network.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 1x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 1x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer
- [Python] v3.6 or later

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [Thread Co-processor] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/ncs-playground` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/ncs-playground
    ```

3. Build the sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    === "Default"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/openthread/coprocessor
        ```

    === "Vendor hooks support"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/openthread/coprocessor -- -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-vendor_hook.conf
        ```

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the firmware to your board, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect nRF52840 Connect Kit to your computer using the USB-C Cable.
2. Get the board’s serial port name (for example, `/dev/cu.usbmodem14201`).
3. Build the OpenThread POSIX applications by performing the following steps:

    1. Enter the `openthread` directory:

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        cd modules/lib/openthread
        ```
    
    2. Install the OpenThread dependencies:

        ``` bash linenums="2"
        ./script/bootstrap
        ```

    3. Build the `ot-daemon` and `ot-ctl` applications with support for Thread v1.2:

        ``` bash linenums="3"
        ./script/cmake-build posix -DOT_THREAD_VERSION=1.2 -DOT_DAEMON=ON
        ```

    You can find the generated applications in `./build/posix/src/posix/`.

4. Open up a terminal window, and start `ot-daemon` with the `--verbose` flag so you can see log output and confirm that it is running:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    sudo ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-daemon 'spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/cu.usbmodem14201?uart-baudrate=115200' --verbose
    ```

    When successful, `ot-daemon` in verbose mode generates output similar to the following:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="2" }
    Feb 10 16:51:15  ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-daemon[56466] <Info>: Running OPENTHREAD/632b63089; POSIX; Feb 10 2023 16:31:19
    Feb 10 16:51:15  ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-daemon[56466] <Info>: Thread version: 3
    Feb 10 16:51:15  ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-daemon[56466] <Info>: Thread interface: utun4
    Feb 10 16:51:15  ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-daemon[56466] <Info>: RCP version: OPENTHREAD/632b63089; Zephyr; Feb 10 2023 16:50:38
    ```

5. Open up a second terminal window and use `ot-ctl` to communicate with the RCP node, specifying the Thread interface `utun4` shown in `ot-daemon` log output:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    sudo ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-ctl -I utun4
    ```

6. From this point, you can follow the [Testing instructions in the CLI] sample by removing the `ot` prefix for each command. For example:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenums="1" }
    > state
    state
    disabled
    Done
    > channel
    channel
    11
    Done
    > panid 0xabcd
    panid 0xabcd
    Done
    ...
    ```
