# USB HID Mouse

## Overview

The USB HID Mouse sample demonstrates the use of a USB Human Interface Device (HID) driver by the Zephyr project. This very simple driver enumerates a board with a button into a mouse that has a left mouse button and optionally (depending on the number of buttons on the board) a right mouse button, X-axis movement, and Y-axis movement. If the USB peripheral driver supports remote wakeup feature, wakeup request will be performed on every button click if the bus is in suspended state.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 1x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 1x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [USB HID Mouse] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/ncs-playground` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/ncs-playground
    ```

3. Build the sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/usb/hid-mouse
    ```

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the firmware to your board, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect nRF52840 Connect Kit to your computer using the USB-C Cable.
2. The board will be detected as a HID mouse named __Zephyr HID mouse sample__.
3. Press __USER__ button on the board. Observe that a left mouse click is activated.
