# Zigbee Shell

## Overview

This Zigbee Shell sample demonstrates a Zigbee router (with the possibility of being a coordinator) that uses the Zigbee shell library for interaction.

You can use this sample for several purposes, including:

- Initial configuration of the network - forming a network as coordinator, adding devices to the network with the install codes, setting the extended PAN ID.
- Benchmarking - measuring time needed for a message to travel from one node to another.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 2x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 2x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [Zigbee Shell] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/connect-micro-project` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/connect-micro-project
    ```

3. Build each sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/zigbee/shell
    ``` 

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the Zigbee Shell firmware, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect the first shell device to your computer using the USB-C Cable.

2. Open up a serial terminal, specifying the correct serial port that your computer uses to communicate with the first shell device:

    === "macOS/Linux"

        Open up a terminal and run:

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        screen <serial-port-name> 115200
        ```

    === "Windows"

        1. Start [PuTTY].
        2. Configure the correct serial port and click __Open__:

3. To set the first shell device to work as coordinator, run the following shell command:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    bdb role zc
    ```

    This shell device is now the shell coordinator node.

4. Run the following command on this shell coordinator node to start a new Zigbee network:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    bdb start
    ```

5. Run the following command on the second shell device:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    bdb start
    ```

    This shell device joins the network.

6. To acquired short address of the second shell device, run the following command:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    zdo short
    ```

    You should see the output, similar to the following:

    ``` {.bash .no-copy linenums="1" }
    uart:~$ zdo short
    50b4
    Done
    ```

7. To check the communication between the nodes, issue a ping request on the coordinator with the acquired short address value and the payload size:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenume="1" }
    zcl ping zdo_short_address payload_size
    ```

    For example:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    zcl ping 0x50b4 10
    ```

    The ping time response is returned when the ping is successful, followed by the additional information from the endpoint logger. For example:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy linenume="1" }
    uart:~$ zcl ping 0x50b4 10
    Ping time: 17 ms
    Done
    [00:08:20.789,245] <inf> zigbee.eprxzcl: Received ZCL command (0): src_addr=0x50b4(short) src_ep=64 dst_ep=64 cluster_id=0xbeef profile_id=0x0104 cmd_dir=0 common_cmd=0 cmd_id=0x01 cmd_seq=0 disable_def_resp=1 manuf_code=void payload=[cdcdcdcdcdcdcdcdcdcd] (0)
    ```

    !!! Tip
        To disable the logs from Zigbee endpoint logger:

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        log disable zigbee.eprxzcl
        ```

        To enable logs from Zigbee endpoint logger and set its logging to the info level (`inf`)

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        log enable inf zigbee.eprxzcl
        ```
