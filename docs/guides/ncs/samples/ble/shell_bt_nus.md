# Bluetooth Low Energy: NUS shell transport

## Overview

The Nordic UART Service (NUS) shell transport sample demonstrates how to use the [Nordic UART Service (NUS) shell transport] to receive shell commands from a remote device over BluetoothÂ®.

When the connection is established, you can connect to the sample through the [Nordic UART Service (NUS)] by using [Web Device CLI]. You can then send shell commands that are executed on the device running the sample.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 1x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 1x USB-C Cable
- Chrome 56+ browser with [Web Bluetooth supported]
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [NUS shell transport] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/connect-micro-project` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/connect-micro-project
    ```

3. Build the sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/ble/shell_bt_nus
    ```

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the firmware to your board, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Power up nRF52840 Connect Kit using the USB-C Cable.
2. Open the [Web Device CLI] page in the Chrome brower:

    [:material-console: Web Device CLI](https://wiki.makerdiary.com/web-device-cli/){ .md-button }

3. Click <kbd>**Connect**</kbd> to scan devices.
4. Pair  __`BT_NUS_shell`__ discovered in the list.
5. Run `help` to print the help message.
