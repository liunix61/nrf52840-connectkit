# Bluetooth Low Energy: Observer

## Overview

The BLE Observer sample demonstrates Bluetooth Low Energy Observer role functionality. The application will periodically scan for devices nearby. If any found, prints the address of the device, the RSSI value, the Advertising type, and the Advertising data length to the console.

If the used Bluetooth Low Energy Controller supports Extended Scanning, you may enable `CONFIG_BT_EXT_ADV` in the project configuration file. Refer to the project configuration file for further details.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 1x [nRF52840 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf52840-connectkit)
- 1x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Linux, or Windows 7 or newer

## Building the sample

Before you start building, remember to [set up the environment](../../setup.md) first.

Use the following steps to build the [BLE Observer] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `my-workspace/ncs-playground` directory created in the [Setting up the environment](../../setup.md#get-the-code) section.

    ``` bash linenums="1"
    cd my-workspace/ncs-playground
    ```

3. Build the sample using the `west` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `connectkit_nrf52840`:

    === "Default"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/ble/observer
        ```
    
    === "Extended Scanning"

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        west build -p always -b connectkit_nrf52840 samples/ble/observer -- -DCONF_FILE=prj_extended.conf
        ```

    !!! Tip
        The `-p always` option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

4. After running the `west build` command, the build files can be found in `build/zephyr`.

## Flashing the firmware

The sample is designed to work with the UF2 Bootloader, so that you can easily flash the sample [using the UF2 Bootloader](../../../../programming/uf2boot.md). The firmware can be found in `build/zephyr` with the name `zephyr.uf2`.

To flash the firmware, complete the following steps:

1. Push and hold the __USER__ button and plug your board into the USB port of your computer. Release the __USER__ button after your board is connected. The RGB LED turns green.

2. It will mount as a Mass Storage Device called __UF2BOOT__.

3. Drag and drop `zephyr.uf2` onto the __UF2BOOT__ volume. The RGB LED blinks red fast during flashing.

4. Reset the board and the sample will start running.

## Testing

After flashing the firmware to your board, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect nRF52840 Connect Kit to your computer using the USB-C Cable.
2. Open up a serial terminal, specifying the correct serial port that your computer uses to communicate with the board:

    === "macOS/Linux"

        Open up a terminal and run:

        ``` bash linenums="1"
        screen <serial-port-name> 115200
        ```

    === "Windows"

        1. Start [PuTTY].
        2. Configure the correct serial port and click __Open__:

3. Observe the output of the terminal. You should see the output, similar to what is shown in the following:

    === "Default"

        ``` { .bash .no-copy }
