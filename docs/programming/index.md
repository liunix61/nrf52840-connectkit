# How to program the nRF52840 Connect Kit

nRF52840 Connect Kit is shipped with the UF2 Bootloader, which is an easy-to-use and self-upgradable bootloader that can be used to update the firmware by just copying the `.uf2`-format images to the flash drive.

Alternatively, you can update the firmware by using DAPLink on another nRF52840 Connect Kit or using Pitaya-Link debug probe.
